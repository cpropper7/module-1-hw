# Public the investment platform that cares

## Overview and Origin

Public.com is an investment platform that allows people to invest in stocks, ETFs, crypto and collectibles. Public was founded in 2018 by Jannick Malling, Leif Abraham, Matt Kennedy, Peter Quinn and Sean Hendelman. They originally were known as Matador, but in 2019 the company performed a major rebrand and renamed itself Public.com [1). An article on domainwire.com provides details on how Public attracted $308.5 million in funding to date, including a $220 million Series D round in February 2021. The same article states that, “this moved Public.com into unicorn territory, with the round moving the company’s valuation up to **$1.2 billion**.” [1) Public got heavy endorsements when they convinced high profile individuals such as Will Smith and Tony Hawk to become investors. The idea to change themselves to Public.com was in hopes to achieve a successful rebrand. They wanted to be seen as the investment platform that was built for the public, not necessarily for the financial trader or tech-savvy investor. [2). 

## Business Activities

To understand the issue that Public is trying to solve we have to take a step back and speak about one of its competitors and the issue they created that the company Public is now trying to solve.
In January 2021 a short squeeze began that would change the way investors would see these investment platforms. Robinhood at the time was the dominant investment platform. Everyone was trying to purchase stocks like GME (Game Stop) because the stock had risen more than 1,800% in the month of January.[3) The only issue is that on Jan 28 Robinhood blocked its users from purchasing shares from GME, AMC, BB, NOK and BBBY- all the meme stocks of the time.[3) This led to a retail investor feeling betrayed and no longer trusting their investment platform. Not only did the retail investor feel like they could not use their platform at the most opportune time but they learned that these investment platforms were participating in payment for order flow.[4) What that meant, in short, was that platforms like Robinhood would sell your order to a wholesaler who would look for your price or better. This raised eyebrows because it meant that you were paying more per share and the wholesalers and Robinhood were pocketing the profits. These even raised red flags on the possibility of these wholesalers front running even though it is illegal.
Now that retail investors feel burned and don’t trust investment platforms like they did prior to this scandal. Which leads to the current issue that needs to be solved. Investment platforms looking out for the retail investor or the “public”, which is exactly what Public.com’s mission and rebranding is about.
The solution that Public.com is trying is by regaining the retail investors trust by stressing that they are 
Per the company website, Public.com is striving to help the retail investor by helping them access custom company metrics, real time analysis and live shows about the markets. They can even get further insight on the markets from the Public community. According to the Public.com website, the company stresses that they work for us and not some trading firm or unknown third party. They explain that this is why they do not participate in payment for order flow. 
As I had mentioned earlier this was the model Robinhood and other competitors had adopted and how they were making most of their money, which in turn had since raised some eyebrows on who these companies actually cared for. On their website, Public mentions the way they make their money through optional tipping, membership, fees, and markups for crypto. The retail market is worth looking out for because, “combined, there are over 100 million users/accounts at just six of the most popular online brokerages for retail investors.” [5) All these investment platforms use a trading platform software to help retail investors with placing orders and information. All that a trading platform is, “a network-based marketplace that provides users with unlimited functionalities to place trades, browse catalogs of financial instruments, and monitor accounts through financial institutions outside the bank dealer community.” [7).

## Landscapes

Before 2015 retail investing was very different from what we see today. An individual interested in investing would have to use a broker dealer and would get charged per transaction. In addition to the fees, accounts required cash minimums. 

So what happened in 2015? The Robinhood app was launched. Robinhood is a financial investment company that allows individuals to invest in stocks, funds and crypto. Their mission was to allow everyone to have access to the financial markets, not just the wealthy. With their app, users could purchase financial products without paying commissions. Not only did this make investing for the retail investor more cost effective, but the ease and accessibility of investing was now a lot easier via using an application. Robinhood changed the way retail investors would invest and because of this.The investment sector had to change their business model to survive. [6) The future in retail trading had officially begun. As time went on, other companies such as webull, Etoro, Acorns, coinbase, gemini, Public and many more came along. All of these companies to this day keep using the trading platform technology innovation to help retail investors place orders and get information in real time.

## Results

The retail investor space has been a growing field since all of these investment platforms were created. Around 15% of retail investors got their start in 2020. [8) This was due to the fact that people were looking for an alternative source of income during the pandemic. “Retail investors made up around 17% of the market in January of 2020, but that number was 25%+ in July and August of that year”. [8) As we keep moving forward the retail investing space is not slowing down and as of January 2021 **8.1 million** average daily trades are being made. It is clear that this space has a large growing audience. As of 2019 Public hit their 1 million user milestone and since then has only been growing. [9).
